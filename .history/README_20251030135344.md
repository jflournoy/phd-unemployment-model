# PhD Unemployment model

- Languages: R and Stan (via brms, cmdstanr)
- Goals: model PhD unemployment relative to sensible baselines (general unemployment, other graduate degrees)
- Development: Use test driven development for code.
- Development environment: we will develop within my running R Studio Quarto Docker container
- Statistical principles: simplest models that will allow maximum disaggregation of data
  - We want to disaggregate into multiple seasonal components, at the very least
  - likely will use GAMs, Gaussian process models, autocorrelation, or other tools appropriate for dense time series
- Data source: [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml)
- Scientific communication: 
  - we should aim to communicate clearly the process of developing this model using TDD
  - we should aim to communicate the modeled inisghts beautifully and clearly (visually and with diagrams and text)
