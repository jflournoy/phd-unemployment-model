=== Parallel Processing Benchmark ===

Testing with smaller n_sims for faster benchmarking
Available cores: 20
Using cores: 19

Running SEQUENTIAL validation (50 simulations)...
Sequential time: 7.73 seconds

=== PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES ===
Measured sequential time: 7.73 seconds (50 sims)
Time per simulation: 0.155 seconds

Estimated time for 300 simulations:
  Sequential: 0.8 minutes
  Parallel (19 cores): 0.1 minutes (estimated)
  Estimated speedup: 13.3x
  Time saved: 0.7 minutes

Note: Parallel processing in dev mode requires package installation.
In production (with installed package), actual speedup should be ~70%% of core count.
