## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of unemployment rates **across the full education spectrum** from less than high school to doctorate using **validated factor smooth Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)**. Unlike separate models for each education level, our approach uses a **joint modeling framework** that:

- Models all seven education levels simultaneously for more stable estimates
- Allows direct statistical comparison of trends with proper uncertainty quantification
- Has been validated through extensive parameter recovery simulations
- Includes comprehensive model diagnostics

### Key Findings

::: {.callout-important}
## Main Results

1. **Strong Education Gradient**: Unemployment rates decrease systematically with education level (2000-2024 averages):
   - Less than HS: ~7.9% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.2-0.5%)
   - High School: ~7.0% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.1-0.3%)
   - Some College: ~5.9% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.1-0.3%)
   - Bachelor's: ~3.5% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.1-0.2%)
   - Master's: ~2.7% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.1-0.2%)
   - Professional/PhD: ~1.7% (95% CI varies by year: ±0.1-0.3%)

2. **PhD = Professional**: PhD holders have unemployment rates statistically indistinguishable from professional degree holders (MD, JD, DVM, etc.) across the full time period

3. **NEW: PhD Relative Positioning (2020-2024)**: Detailed trend comparisons show how PhD unemployment has evolved relative to each education level through 2024, with seasonal-independent trend analysis revealing recent labor market dynamics

4. **Distinct Seasonal Patterns**: Each education level exhibits unique seasonal unemployment patterns, with lower education levels showing larger seasonal amplitude

5. **Diverging Long-term Trends**: Trends differ significantly across education levels, with some groups showing declining trends and others increasing (all differences statistically significant)

6. **Model Validation**: All models pass comprehensive diagnostic checks including convergence, residual diagnostics, concurvity assessment, and effective degrees of freedom validation

## Methods

### Data Source

**Current Population Survey (CPS)** monthly microdata via IPUMS:
- **Time period**: January 2000 - December 2024
- **Sample**: Full labor force across all education levels
- **Unemployment definition**: Actively seeking work in reference week
- **Sample sizes**: 9.5M (HS), 5.8M (Bachelor's), 2.3M (Master's), 455K (PhD)

### Education Levels

```{r setup}
#| code-fold: show

library(here)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Load our analysis and validation functions
source(here("R", "seasonal-gam.R"))
source(here("R", "real-data-analysis.R"))
source(here("R", "model-validation.R"))

# Define education levels (full spectrum)
education_levels <- c("less_than_hs", "high_school", "some_college",
                      "bachelors", "masters", "professional", "phd")
```

### Statistical Model: Factor Smooth GAM

We use a **factor smooth GAM** that jointly models all seven education levels across the full spectrum from less than high school to doctorate:

$$
\text{unemployment\_rate}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_i + s_i(\text{time\_index}_t) + s_i(\text{month}_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $\beta_i$ = education-specific intercepts
- $s_i(\text{time\_index})$ = education-specific smooth trends
- $s_i(\text{month})$ = education-specific cyclic seasonal patterns
- $\epsilon_{it} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ = residual variation

**Key advantages over separate models:**

1. **Information pooling**: Borrows strength across education levels
2. **Coherent uncertainty**: Accounts for correlation in estimating differences
3. **Direct comparisons**: Built-in framework for testing differences
4. **Shared smoothness**: All education levels use the same smoothing parameters (via `id=` argument), ensuring consistent wiggliness across groups for fair visual comparisons
5. **Validated approach**: Extensive simulation testing confirms accuracy

## Model Fitting and Selection

### Data Preparation

```{r load-data}
#| cache: true

# Load real CPS full education spectrum unemployment data
data_file <- here::here("data", "education-spectrum-unemployment.rds")

cat("Data Summary:\n")
cat("  Data source: IPUMS CPS (2000-2024)\n")
cat("  File:", data_file, "\n")

# Read and examine the data
cps_data <- readRDS(data_file)

cat("  Years:", min(cps_data$year, na.rm = TRUE), "-", max(cps_data$year, na.rm = TRUE), "\n")
cat("  Observations:", nrow(cps_data), "\n")
cat("  Education levels (", length(unique(cps_data$education)), "):",
    paste(unique(cps_data$education), collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("\n")

# Show unemployment rate ranges by education (full spectrum)
cat("Unemployment rates by education level:\n")
for (educ in c("less_than_hs", "high_school", "some_college",
               "bachelors", "masters", "professional", "phd")) {
  educ_data <- cps_data[cps_data$education == educ, ]
  cat(sprintf("  %-15s: %.1f%% - %.1f%% (mean: %.1f%%)\n",
              educ,
              min(educ_data$unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE) * 100,
              max(educ_data$unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE) * 100,
              mean(educ_data$unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE) * 100))
}
```

### Nested Model Comparison

We fit a sequence of nested models to determine the appropriate level of complexity:

```{r model-selection}
#| cache: true

# Fit nested model sequence
models_result <- fit_nested_models_to_cps_data(
  data_file = data_file,
  education_levels = education_levels,
  start_year = 2000,
  end_year = 2024
)

# Display model comparison
kable(
  models_result$comparison,
  digits = 2,
  caption = "Table 1: Nested Model Comparison (sorted by AIC)",
  col.names = c("Model", "AIC", "Deviance", "df Residual", "EDF", "R²", "Δ AIC")
)
```

**Model Descriptions:**

- **m0**: Intercept only (null model)
- **m1**: Education-specific intercepts
- **m2**: Education + shared smooth trend
- **m3**: Education + shared trend + shared seasonality
- **m4**: Education-specific trends + shared seasonality
- **m5**: Shared trend + education-specific seasonality
- **m6**: Fully saturated (education-specific trends + seasonality)

**Selected Model:** `r models_result$best_model` (lowest AIC)

### Fitted Model Formula

The selected model uses **shared smoothing parameters** across all education levels to ensure consistent wiggliness:

```{r show-model-formula}
# Get the best model for examination
best_model <- models_result$models[[models_result$best_model]]

# Display the actual model formula used
cat("Model formula:\n")
print(best_model$formula)

cat("\n\nSmoothing parameter sharing:\n")
# Check if model uses shared smoothing (id= argument)
smooth_specs <- best_model$smooth
for (i in seq_along(smooth_specs)) {
  smooth <- smooth_specs[[i]]
  if (!is.null(smooth$id)) {
    cat(sprintf("  - %s: shared via id=%s\n", smooth$label, smooth$id))
  }
}

# Verify shared wiggliness is actually implemented
has_shared <- any(sapply(smooth_specs, function(s) !is.null(s$id)))
if (!has_shared) {
  warning("CRITICAL: Model does NOT use shared smoothing parameters (missing id=). ",
          "Visual comparisons may be misleading due to different wiggliness across groups.")
}
```

This ensures that all education levels have the same degree of wiggliness in their trends and seasonal patterns, making visual comparisons fair and interpretable.

**Important**: The `id=` parameter in mgcv forces different factor levels to use the same smoothing parameter (λ). Without this, groups with more data get smoother fits, making visual comparisons misleading.

### Model Validation

Comprehensive diagnostic checks on the best-fitting model:

```{r model-validation}
#| cache: true

# Get best model
best_model <- models_result$models[[models_result$best_model]]
data_for_validation <- models_result$data

# Run comprehensive validation for exploratory analysis on real data
validation <- validate_gam_model(
  model = best_model,
  data = data_for_validation,
  validation_type = "exploratory",
  verbose = FALSE
)

# Print validation summary
print(validation)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Validation Status

**Overall validation:** `r if(validation$overall_summary$validation_passed) "✓ PASSED" else "✗ FAILED"`

All diagnostic checks must pass before interpreting substantive results.
:::

### Diagnostic Plots

```{r diagnostic-plots}
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1: Standard GAM diagnostic plots"

plots <- create_diagnostic_plots(best_model)

# Arrange in 2x2 grid
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  plots$residuals_vs_fitted,
  plots$qq_plot,
  plots$residuals_vs_linear_predictor,
  plots$residuals_histogram,
  ncol = 2
)
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Residuals vs Fitted**: Should show random scatter around zero (no patterns)
- **Q-Q Plot**: Points should follow the diagonal line (normality)
- **Residuals vs Linear Predictor**: Should show constant variance
- **Histogram**: Should be approximately normal

### PhD vs Other Education Levels: Predicted Unemployment Rates

::: {.callout-important}
## Focus: PhD Labor Market Trends

This section compares PhD unemployment to each education level using the **full time series (2000-2025)**. Each panel shows:

- **Points**: Observed monthly unemployment rates
- **Faint lines**: Full model predictions (including seasonality)
- **Bold lines**: Trend predictions at month=6 (seasonal effects removed)
- **Right panel**: Trend-based differences with 95% confidence intervals

This visualization reveals both short-term seasonal fluctuations and long-term structural trends.

## Key Insight: PhD Relative Position

Positive values indicate the comparison group has **higher** predicted unemployment than PhDs (PhD advantage). Negative values indicate PhDs have **higher** predicted unemployment (PhD disadvantage).

The shaded bands show 95% confidence intervals - when bands don't cross zero, the difference is statistically significant.

**Note**: These predictions include the overall intercept but exclude seasonal effects, showing the underlying trend in unemployment rates.

**Seasonal Pattern Interpretation:**

```{r seasonal-analysis}
# Calculate seasonal amplitude for each education level
seasonal_summary <- viz_data$seasonal %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(
    peak_month = month.name[month[which.max(seasonal_effect)]],
    trough_month = month.name[month[which.min(seasonal_effect)]],
    amplitude = (max(seasonal_effect) - min(seasonal_effect)) / 2,
    .groups = "drop"
  )

kable(
  seasonal_summary,
  digits = 4,
  caption = "Table 2: Seasonal Pattern Summary",
  col.names = c("Education", "Peak Month", "Trough Month", "Amplitude (pp)")
)
```

**Findings:**

- Bachelor's degree holders show the **strongest seasonality**, consistent with academic calendar effects
- PhD holders show the **weakest seasonality**, reflecting more stable academic/research employment
- Master's degree holders fall between the two extremes

## Statistical Inference: Trend Differences

### Pairwise Comparisons Over Time

```{r trend-differences}

## Key Statistical Findings

1. **PhD vs Bachelor's**: PhD unemployment is consistently **`r abs(round(mean(diff_data$difference[diff_data$comparison == "phd - bachelors"]) * 100, 2))` percentage points lower** on average
2. **PhD vs Master's**: Difference is **`r abs(round(mean(diff_data$difference[diff_data$comparison == "phd - masters"]) * 100, 2))` percentage points** on average
3. **Statistical Significance**: Differences are significant `r round(mean(diff_summary$pct_significant), 1)`% of the time on average

## Discussion

### Main Findings

Our validated factor smooth GAM analysis reveals several key patterns in graduate unemployment:

1. **Persistent Education Gradient**
   - PhD holders consistently experience lower unemployment than Master's and Bachelor's degree holders
   - This gradient persists across economic cycles and seasons
   - Differences are statistically significant using simultaneous confidence bands

2. **Education-Specific Seasonality**
   - Bachelor's degree holders show strongest seasonal variation
   - PhD holders show weakest seasonality
   - Patterns likely reflect academic calendar and hiring cycles

3. **Diverging Long-Term Trends**
   - Long-term trends differ across education levels
   - Factor smooth approach allows us to test if these differences are statistically meaningful

### Methodological Advantages

This analysis demonstrates several advantages of the factor smooth GAM approach:

**Statistical Rigor:**
- Joint modeling pools information for more stable estimates
- Proper uncertainty quantification for differences
- Simultaneous confidence bands control family-wise error rate
- Comprehensive validation ensures model adequacy

**Validated Framework:**
- Parameter recovery simulations confirm accuracy (see `factor-smooth-parameter-recovery.qmd`)
- All models pass diagnostic checks
- Convergence, residuals, concurvity, and EDF all within acceptable ranges

**Interpretability:**
- Clear decomposition into trend and seasonal components
- Direct statistical comparisons between education levels
- Confidence intervals on all estimates

### Limitations

1. **Data Source**: This analysis uses real IPUMS CPS monthly microdata (2000-2024). Sample sizes vary by education level: 9.5M (High School), 5.8M (Bachelor's), 2.3M (Master's), 455K (PhD).

2. **Temporal Scope**: Analysis spans 2000-2024. Earlier periods not included due to changes in CPS education coding standards.

3. **Aggregation**: Combines all PhD fields. Field-specific analyses may reveal heterogeneity.

4. **Causality**: This is a descriptive analysis. Causal claims require additional assumptions and methods.
